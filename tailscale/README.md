# Tailscale Mesh VPN

Authenticate and connect to the tailscale network

```bash
docker-compose exec tailscale tailscale up
```

Get status all clients

```bash
docker exec tailscale tailscale status
```

## Access PiHole over tailscale

```bash
docker-compose exec tailscale tailscale up --accept-dns=false
```

Set DNS servers on [tailscale's console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns)
Under Global nameservers, add a custom IP, which would be the Pi's local IP

Enable the `Override local DNS` to override any local DNS settings
Also disable key expiry to prevent DNS interruptions when tailscale re-authenticates

The same can be done with [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)

## Sharing machines

Go to the [tailscale console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)

Select the machine to share and click on share, which will create a link which can be shared with other users

## Setup exit node and subnet routes

**Exit node**

Advertise as exit node

```bash
> docker exec tailscale tailscale up --advertise-exit-node
Warning: IPv6 forwarding is disabled.
Subnet routes and exit nodes may not work correctly.
See https://tailscale.com/s/ip-forwarding
```

> Enabling masquerading is also required for setting up a subnet router

```bash
> _ firewall-cmd --add-masquerade --zone=public
success
> _ firewall-cmd --list-all
public (active)
  target: default
...
  masquerade: yes
...
```

This will still complain about IPv6 forwarding. Solution is to eiher disable IPv6 or add a rich rule for IPv6

```bash
> _ firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv6 masquerade'
success
> _ firewall-cmd --list-all
...
  rich rules:
        rule family="ipv6" masquerade
```

```bash
> _ sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
> _ sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
```

Now `docker exec tailscale tailscale up --advertise-exit-node` will be executed without any error

This means if I enable exit node on a client, I can use tailscale as a full tunnel VPN as opposed to the default split tunnel mode

**Add Subnet routing**

Add the option `--advertise-routes=192.x.x.0/24` to

> 0 is to advertise entore subnet and /24 is the subnet mask for 255.255.255.0

Both the above configs can be verified by the [machines page on the admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)

![machines_overview](./images/machines_overview.png)

This can also be verified via teh status command

```bash
> docker exec tailscale tailscale status
x.x.x.x  niflheim             user.name@ linux   idle; offers exit node
...
```

Next, enable both the subnet and the exit node config under `edit route settings`

### Using the exit node on other clients

#### Linux

This will use (in my case) niflheim as the exit node for all the requests

```bash
> _ tailscale up --exit-node [exitnode-hostname or IP]
```

To stop

```bash
> _ tailscale up --exit-node ''
```

The `--accept-routes` option will accept advertised routes from other clients, since by default linux devices don't

#### Windows

Select the hostname from menu of the tailscale tray icon to start using an exit node

#### Android

Select the hostname from the menu in the top right corner to start using an exit node
